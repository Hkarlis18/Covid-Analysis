# Covid-Analysis

The following project seeks to get insights from the data collected in order to examine in detail the number of COVID cases worldwide, in addition to the number 
of people vaccinated by country during 2020 and 2021.

+ Bear in mind that the original author of this project is Alex the Analyst. I just decided to make some changes during the process.
